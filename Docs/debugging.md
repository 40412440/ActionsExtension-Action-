# Debugging

## Gameplay Debugger

Actions can be debugged in-game with [gameplay debugger](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Tools/GameplayDebugger).

Actions will display for the focused actor, its controller and the current player controller (the first local player). It is displayed as a tree of sub-actions.

Like any other normal Blueprint, blueprint debugging is supported such as instance selection or visualization of graphs.
