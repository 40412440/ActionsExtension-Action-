# Exposing Variables

Most of the times, when we have an action, we want to feed it with variables to customize its behavior, and as you will see, it's very easy to do so.

First open your Action blueprint and add a new variable of any type

![New Variable](img/new_variable.png)

Mark the variable as Editable

![Editable](img/editable_variable.png)

Finally, check "**Expose on Spawn**" as true

![Expose on Spawn](img/expose_on_spawn.png)

This variable will now show up on all action nodes.

{% hint style='tip' %} If a variable doesn't appear on an action node, **right click -> Refresh Node** to refresh it {% endhint %}
